# ADR-0001: Licensing and Repository Posture

Status: Accepted
Date: 2025-10-08

## Context
We operate an open-core strategy. The server implementation should encourage contribution while protecting hosted/network use per AGPL-3.0.

## Decision
- License the server repository under GNU AGPL-3.0 (SPDX: AGPL-3.0-only).
- Provide a commercial license option for organizations unable to comply with AGPL obligations.
- README includes a "Commercial license available" note with contact `legal@registryaccord.org`.

## Rationale
- Aligns with service posture and encourages contributions while ensuring improvements to network services are upstreamed.
- Keeps SDKs/libraries in other repos permissive as needed.

## Consequences
- All contributions are under AGPL-3.0 unless otherwise agreed.
- Dual-licensing discussions handled through the provided contact.
